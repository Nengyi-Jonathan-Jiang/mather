1. The end of a chain, of mass per unit length "\mu", at rest on a tabletop at "t=0", is lifted vertically at a constant speed "v". Evaluate the upward lifting force as a function of time

"\indent{
    F=mg=\mu gh=\box{\mu gvt}
}"

2. A large block of mass "m_b" is located on a horizontal frictionless surface. A second block of mass "m_t" is located on top of the first block; the coefficient of friction (both static and kinetic) between the two blocks is given by "\mu". All surfaces are horizontal; all motion is effectively one dimensional. A spring with spring constant "k" is connected to the top block only; the spring obeys Hooke's Law equally in both extension and compression. Assume that the top block never falls off the bottom block; you may assume that the bottom block is very, very long. The top block is moved a distance A away from the equilibrium position and then released from rest.

(a) Depending on the value of "A", the motion can be divided into two types: motion that experiences no frictional energy losses and motion that does. Find the value "A_c" that divides the two motion types."

"\indent{
    F=-kx;
    f_s = \mu m_tg
        = \frac{Fm_b}{m_t + m_b}
        = \frac{kA_cm_b}{m_t + m_b}\
    kA_c=\frac{\mu m_tg (m_t + m_b)}{m_b}\
    \box{A_c=\frac{\mu m_tg}{km_b}(m_t + m_b)}
}"

(b) Consider now the scenario where "A>>A_c". In this scenario the amplitude of the oscillation of the top block as measured against the original equilibrium position will change with time. Determine the magnitude of the change in amplitude, "\Delta A", after one complete oscillation.

"\indent{
    a_b=\frac{f_k}{m_b}=\mu\frac{m_t}{m_b}g\
    \Delta x_b=\frac1 2a_b(\frac\pi{\omega_t})^2=\frac{\pi^2}2\mu
    g\frac{m_t}{m_b}\frac{m_t}k\
    \frac{\Delta x_b}{2A}=\frac{A_c}A*\frac{\pi^2}4*\frac1{1+\frac{m_b}{m_t}}<<1
}
\
\indent{
    \frac1 2kA^2=\frac1 2k(A-\Delta A)^2+\mu m_tg*4A\
    kA\Delta A=\mu m_tg*4A\
    \Delta A=\frac{4\mu m_tg}k
}"


(c) Assume still that "A>>A_c". What is the maximum speed of the bottom block during the first complete oscillation cycle of the upper block?

"\indent{
    v_{bmax}=a_b*\frac\pi{\omega_t}=\mu\frac{m_t}{m_b}g*\pi/\sqrt{\frac k{m_t}}=\pi\frac{\mu m_tg}{m_b}\sqrt{\frac{m_t}k}
}"
